## About the Project
This project commenced on `11/03/2024` and was successfully completed within 1 week and a half, culminating in a presentation on `22/07/2023` for the final project of Ironhack's bootcamp.

Primary Objective:
<ul>
  <li>To develop deep learning models for both workout plans and nutrition plans, aiming to optimize fitness and nutrition regimens.</li>
</ul>

Secondary Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>To create a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to generate personalized workout and nutrition plans based on their goals and preferences.</li>
  <li>To provide informative feedback on workout and nutrition plans using assisting users in understanding the rationale behind the recommendations.</li>
</ul>


## About Fitness and Nutrition
### Glossary
<p align="justify">Let¬¥s define some key terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> The state of being physically active and healthy, typically as a result of exercise and proper nutrition.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> The process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Workout Plans:</strong> Structured routines designed to improve physical fitness, including exercises targeting various muscle groups and cardiovascular health.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrition Plans:</strong> Tailored dietary guidelines aimed at achieving specific health or fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or improved athletic performance.</li>
</ul>

### Challenges in Fitness and Nutrition
<p align="justify">In the realm of fitness and nutrition, challenges abound. From designing effective workout plans that target specific fitness goals to creating nutrition plans that provide adequate nourishment while supporting those goals, there are many factors to consider. Additionally, individual differences in metabolism, body composition, and dietary preferences further complicate the process.</p>

  <small><em>Achieving fitness and nutrition goals requires a holistic approach that considers various factors, including exercise, diet, and lifestyle choices.</em></small>
</p>

### Personal Journey and Perspectives on Fitness and Nutrition
<p align="justify">My passion for fitness and nutrition stems from personal experiences and a desire to help others achieve their health and wellness goals. Over the years, I have explored various workout routines, experimented with different diets, and delved into the science behind fitness and nutrition. Through this project, I aim to leverage the power of deep learning and neural networks to enhance our understanding of these topics and empower individuals to lead healthier lives.</p>

    <li>The linear regression model demonstrated strong performance in predicting BMI values, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test dataset.</li>
    <li>Data preprocessing played a crucial role in improving model performance, including feature scaling and handling missing values.</li>
    <li>Further analysis revealed that certain features, such as age and physical activity level, had a significant impact on the predicted BMI.</li>
</ol>
